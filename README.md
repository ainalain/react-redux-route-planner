# React-redux-route-planner
*This is a homework task, finished in 5 days.*

A react-redux app that calculates the best route (by time) for selected places.
It uses Google Maps Javascript API.
The result of the calculation is represented by a route drawn on the map and by a panel with saved history.
When someone clicks on any item of this history list, the map will be updated.
