# React-redux-route-planner
*This is a homework task, finished in 5 days.*

A demo for my homework project based on react-redux stack and Google Maps Javascript API.

Please note, that there was not much time for development, so there are some bugs.
The app doesn't look good in Safari, but Chrome, Firefox and Android seem to manage the rendering.
